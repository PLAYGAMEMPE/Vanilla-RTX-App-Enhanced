/// <summary>
/// Strips a pack back to color-only: deletes every MER/MERS/normal/heightmap texture that a
/// .texture_set.json references, then every .texture_set.json itself. Color textures are
/// never touched.
///
/// Lives under Tools/, not Core/, because it isn't part of the generation pipeline - it's a
/// conditional pass the pipeline may or may not run, only when the user explicitly agreed to
/// it for a given pack (see AlchitexWindow's confirmation dialog).
///
/// Why it exists: packs increasingly declare the "pbr" (Vibrant Visuals) or "raytraced"
/// capability while shipping little or no actual PBR content - and those are exactly the
/// packs people want RTX Reactor for. Alchitex skips any texture already claimed by a
/// texture set, so without stripping first it would no-op on them.
///
/// ONLY ever run against the staged temp copy, never the pack the user selected. The caller
/// is AlchitexPipeline, right after AlchitexStaging.CreateTempCopy. That's what makes a
/// destructive pass like this safe to offer at all: the original is never opened for
/// writing, and a failed or aborted run leaves a temp folder to be swept, not a gutted pack.
///
/// How targets are chosen - this part matters, and the obvious shortcut is wrong:
///
///   * What gets deleted is strictly what TextureSetHelper RESOLVED as a set's MER/MERS or
///     normal/heightmap layer. Never a name-pattern sweep. Plenty of legitimate *color*
///     textures end in "_normal" - sandstone_normal, rail_turned_normal - where "normal"
///     means the ordinary variant of a block, not a normal map. Guessing by suffix would
///     delete those outright, in packs that did nothing wrong.
///
///   * On top of each resolved path, the same name under every other supported extension is
///     deleted too. TextureSetHelper hands back only the one file the game would actually
///     load (.tga > .png > .jpg > .jpeg), so a "foo_mer.png" sitting next to the
///     "foo_mer.tga" it resolved would otherwise survive as an orphan and get picked up as
///     a color texture on the regeneration pass. Those extra three paths are pure guesses
///     that usually don't exist, which is exactly why this is safe: the name came from a
///     real resolved PBR layer either way.
///
///   * Texture sets TextureSetHelper couldn't resolve (malformed JSON, MER and MERS both
///     declared, an unresolvable color layer) still get their .json deleted, but their
///     textures are left alone - there's no trustworthy way to know what they pointed at.
///     A pack in that state may keep some orphans; that's the pack's own doing, and it's
///     strictly better than deleting a file on a guess.
///
/// Every layer path resolves inside the texture set's own folder by construction, so there's
/// no way for any of this to reach outside the pack.
///
/// -- SCOPE --------------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// The defaults are the pack-regeneration behavior described above: the whole tree, every
/// texture set. The two optional parameters narrow that for PbrTestBench, which regenerates
/// individually chosen textures in a folder of somebody's working files and must not touch
/// the ones sitting next to them. They exist so there is exactly one implementation of
/// "which files is it safe to delete here" - an earlier version of the test bench carried
/// its own copy, including its own copy of ExtensionVariants, which is precisely the kind of
/// duplicate that goes stale the first time this rule changes.
