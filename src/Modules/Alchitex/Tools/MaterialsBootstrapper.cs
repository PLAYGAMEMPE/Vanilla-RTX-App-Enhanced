/// Debug-only tool: reads every .texture_set.json in an already-fully-PBR'd pack (e.g.
/// the Cubeir's own Vanilla RTX) and reverse-derives materials.json entries from what's
/// actually baked into each MER/MERS texture, so tuning starts from real numbers instead
/// of a blank sheet.
///
/// Lives under Tools/, not Core/, since it isn't part of the generation pipeline itself -
/// it's a one-off dev utility for bootstrapping materials.json, wired to a debug-only
/// button in the Alchitex window.
///
/// Append-only by design: this is meant to be re-run repeatedly as the artist's ongoing
/// workflow for adding new materials over time, not a one-shot "regenerate everything"
/// tool. If the chosen output file already has an entry for a given texture name, that
/// entry is left completely untouched - only genuinely new names get written, so the
/// artist can always go straight to whatever's new after a run instead of re-diffing the
/// whole file. The output is always written back with "default" first, then every other
/// key alphabetical, so new entries land in a predictable, easy-to-locate place - and
/// because that ordering is applied to the whole set, a file that had drifted out of order
/// comes back sorted.
///
/// -- THE OUTPUT IS A FOLDER, NOT A FILE, AND THAT IS A BUG FIX ------------------------
///
/// The caller picks the folder materials.json lives in; this appends to whatever is already
/// there. It used to take the path from a save-file picker so the artist could point at
/// their existing materials.json directly - which read beautifully and destroyed the file.
/// WinRT's FileSavePicker CREATES OR TRUNCATES the chosen file as part of returning it, so
/// by the time the merge got round to reading "the existing file" it was reading zero bytes,
/// found nothing to merge, and wrote back only the entries derived from this run. Every
/// hand-tuned entry, gone, with the tool reporting success. A picker that hands back a path
/// is not the same as a picker that hands back a path *and has already emptied it*.
///
/// Nothing here writes to disk until the merged result is complete - read fully into memory,
/// merge, sort, one write.
///
/// What gets derived per new texture, straight from the baked MER/MERS pixels:
///   - metal_min/max, emissive_min/max, roughness_min/max - the observed min/max of the
///     R/G/B channels respectively, across the texture's real-colour pixels (see
///     SampleMerRanges - it is ColorField.IsRealColorData, the same rule generation uses,
///     and the two agreeing is load-bearing rather than tidy).
///   - sss_min/max - the observed min/max of the alpha channel, but only if the texture
///     set uses metalness_emissive_roughness_subsurface (MERS). Left at (0, 0) for plain
///     MER sets (Vanilla RTX, being an existing pack, may still have MER-only entries -
///     Alchitex's own generator always produces MERS going forward, but this tool reads
///     whatever's actually there).
///   - Invisible Emission data (has its own algorithm derived from color texture + MER(s))
///
/// What's deliberately left at MaterialEntry's built-in defaults, because none of it is
/// something you can objectively reverse-engineer from a single baked texture:
///   - every invert_* flag, recursive passes, heightmap.intensity, normal.intensity/invert.
/// Every newly-derived entry is a genuine starting point meant to be hand-tuned afterwards,
/// not a finished materials.json.
