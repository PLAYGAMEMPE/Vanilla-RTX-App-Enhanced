/// <summary>
/// DEVELOPER TOOL. Runs loose texture files - or a whole folder of them - through the real
/// PBR generation path, exactly as if they had been discovered inside a resource pack, and
/// writes the results next to the originals.
///
/// Why it exists: testing a PBR change otherwise means assembling a throwaway pack,
/// generating it, looking at the output, deleting the pack, and starting over. That loop is
/// the single biggest cost of iterating on PbrGeneration. This collapses it to "point at a
/// folder of textures, look at what comes out, change something, do it again".
///
/// -- WHAT THIS IS NOT ------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// It is not a second pipeline. It has no generation logic of its own and never will: every
/// decision - which files count as color textures, which names are junk, blacklist handling,
/// normal-vs-heightmap resolution, and every pixel - comes from Core. This file only moves
/// files around so that Core sees the shape it expects.
///
/// It also runs *only* the texture-set + pixel-generation phases (pipeline steps 2a/2b).
/// No staging, no promotion, no water/glass, no fog, no manifest, no icon. Those operate on
/// a pack, and there is no pack here.
///
/// -- WHY IT STAGES INTO A TEMP FOLDER --------------------------------------------------
///
/// TextureSetOrchestrator finds its work through AlchitexStaging.DiscoverBlocksFolders,
/// which looks for a folder literally named "blocks" whose parent is named "textures". A
/// scratch folder full of PNGs is not that shape. Rather than teach Core about a second
/// discovery mode (or, worse, reimplement the orchestrator's filtering here where it would
/// quietly drift), the selected textures are copied into a throwaway
/// &lt;temp&gt;/textures/blocks/ tree, run through the untouched production path, and the
/// files that generation *added* are copied back out.
///
/// Copying back only what generation added - a before/after diff of the temp tree rather
/// than a list of expected suffixes - is deliberate: if the pipeline ever starts emitting a
/// fourth output, it lands in the results with no change here.
///
/// -- ORDER OF OPERATIONS, AND WHY IT'S THIS ORDER --------------------------------------
///
/// The staged copy is stripped first, then generated into; the destination folders are
/// stripped and written only once generation has actually succeeded. So a crash, a cancel,
/// or a bad texture leaves the user's folders exactly as they were, rather than stripped bare
/// with nothing to show for it. Both strips are what make re-running idempotent - without
/// them, TextureSetOrchestrator skips every texture the *previous* run already claimed with a
/// .texture_set.json, and changing the Secondary PBR option would leave last run's orphaned
/// _normal.tga sitting next to this run's _heightmap.tga.
///
/// DESTRUCTIVE, and outside the temp-copy safety net the real pipeline enjoys (§4.2) - by
/// necessity, since the whole point is regenerating in place. The caller must confirm with
/// the user first; Survey() exists to give that dialog real numbers rather than a vague
/// warning.
///
/// -- WHAT GETS REMOVED ------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// PbrStripper, scoped: this folder only (not below it), and only the texture sets whose
/// *color* layer is one of the textures just regenerated. Everything else beside them is
/// left alone.
///
/// That scoping lives in PbrStripper rather than here on purpose. This file briefly carried
/// its own removal pass - including its own copy of the extension-variants rule - because
/// the stripper only did whole trees, which would wipe a neighbour's PBR when one file is
/// picked. Two implementations of "which files is it safe to delete" is a far worse problem
/// than two optional parameters: the rule is subtle (a set's PBR layers come from
/// TextureSetHelper's resolution, never from name suffixes, because sandstone_normal.png is
/// a *color* texture) and the copy would go stale the first time it changed.
