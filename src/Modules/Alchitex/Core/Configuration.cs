// This file holds three small, closely related pieces of "what should this run do" state -
// the artist-authored per-block JSON schema, the PBR blacklist, and the UI-facing per-run
// toggles - rather than splitting them into separate files for subsystems this small.

#region Materials Schema (materials.json)

// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Two layers of types live here, and the split is load-bearing:
//
//   * The DTOs (MerParams, SssParams, ...) are what JSON deserializes into. EVERY property
//     on them is nullable, and that is the whole point: without nullability there is no way
//     to tell "the artist wrote 0" from "the artist wrote nothing", so a per-property
//     fallback to the "default" entry is impossible. A non-nullable int silently reads as 0
//     for both cases.
//
//   * The Resolved* types are what the generators consume. Every value is present, in
//     range, and already merged. Nothing downstream of MaterialsConfig.Resolve ever has to
//     null-check or clamp.
//
// The merge is: this entry's value, else the "default" entry's value, else a built-in
// constant. So an entry can say nothing but {"mer": {"emissive_max": 200}} and inherit the
// rest of the artist's own defaults rather than the code's - which is what makes
// materials.json editable by hand without repeating every field on every block.
