    #region Blend render method suitability

    // Minecraft RTX renders a fixed set of blocks with the "blend" material instance: glass,
    // glass panes, tinted glass, hard glass (Education Edition), copper grates, slime and
    // honey. What follows exists because a texture authored to look right in Fancy graphics
    // is usually authored *wrong* for that renderer, in two specific ways.
    //
    // -- WHAT THE RENDERER ACTUALLY DOES ---------------------------------------------------
    //
    // Two independent things decide how much light reaches the far side of a blend surface:
    //
    //   alpha       - transparency. At full opacity the block reads as an ordinary solid; the
    //                 refraction and internal reflection only appear below it.
    //   the colour  - clarity. The colour acts as a per-channel filter on what passes
    //                 through. Fully black at alpha 0 transmits nothing at all; fully white
    //                 at alpha 0 is crystal-clear glass.
    //
    // The second is the one texture artists don't expect, and it is why deeply saturated
    // glass comes out nearly opaque under RTX. A pure red (255,0,0) absorbs *all* the green
    // and blue; (255,64,64) reads as almost the same red to the eye while letting far more
    // light through. So the quantity that matters is the **smallest channel** - the amount of
    // white light the filter passes - which in HSV terms is exactly value x (1 - saturation).
    //
    // -- THE THREE THINGS THIS DOES --------------------------------------------------------
    //
    //   1. Maximise transparency without flattening it. Every translucent pixel drops by the
    //      same amount, until the most transparent one reaches 0. Uniform, so the texture's
    //      internal composition survives intact.
    //   2. Open the holes. A pixel that is near-invisible *and* near-black is a hole - a gap
    //      in a copper grate, the empty middle of a pane - and black at zero alpha blocks all
    //      light, which is never what a hole is for. It becomes white at the same alpha.
    //   3. Lift transmission, keeping the colour. See LiftTransmission - this is the part
    //      with an actual idea in it.
    //
    // Opaque pixels are spared by all three. Alpha at or above BlendOpaqueThreshold was set
    // deliberately, reads as solid in Fancy, and should read as solid here too.
    //
    // -- WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY IT WAS BACKWARDS --------------------------------------
    //
    // The legacy pass (two of them, actually - a "glass" modifier and a "basic glass" one,
    // dispatched by substring-matching the file name) did the opposite of the above on both
    // counts. It forced `value = 1.0` on every translucent pixel, erasing the difference
    // between clear, grey, smoked and black glass outright; and it *added* 0.1 saturation,
    // which by the paragraph above makes glass strictly more absorptive - the single change
    // most guaranteed to darken it. It also whited out every pixel below alpha 64 regardless
    // of colour, so a deliberately tinted low-alpha pane lost its tint entirely.

    // TODO(tuning): every constant below wants an artist's eye against real generated glass.
