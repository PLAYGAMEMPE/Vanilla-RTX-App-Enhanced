# PackUpdateAnnouncements

### Known Issue
Known issue: due to a game issue (MCPE-240950), animated textures have a minor visual glitch in Vanilla RTX, if that bothers you, stick to Vanilla RTX Normals/Opus, which aren't impacted by MCPE-240950

## 1.26.21 [cd:"9999999"] [glyph:"E70F"]
1.26.21 Release Notes:

This is a quality update, continuing atmospheric overhaul across more biomes, alongside major PBR material improvements for several blocks.

- Ocean Atmosphere & Water Colors:
Regular Ocean now uses a Plains-like atmosphere with default fog, but features significantly deeper blue water, the thermocline darkens much faster with depth.
Lukewarm Ocean, Warm Ocean, and their Deep variants now feature a hotter Desert-inspired atmosphere, tuned to remain significantly milder and more beach-like.
Water colors now derived using a more consistent mathematical formula/model for representing vanilla colors with ray tracing.

- End-related blocks:
Revamped PBR materials for End Stone, End Bricks, and End Portal Frame.
End Portal Frame green parts are now treated as and appear to be made out of Dark Prismarine.
End Stone parts are now consistent with End Stone and feature more detailed materials.
End Stone and End Portal Frame now feature new, more detailed hand-drawn normal maps. End Stone sections are now consistent.
End Stone and End Portal Frame heightmaps revamped.
Removed the subtle noise from End Bricks.
Purpur materials are now slightly glossier by default. Revised Purpur block heightmaps

- Bedrock:
Complete Bedrock block overhaul with improved normal map and heightmap. They now follow a style similar to Stone.
MERS now use semi-ultra-rough materials with extremely subtle metalness visible on the brightest parts of Bedrock. This is primarily noticeable under sunlight and other strong lights, it still remains an ultra-rough yet slightly metallic, extremely tough-looking material.

- Coral:
Revamped all Coral blocks, Coral Fans, and Coral Plants across all colors. New normal maps and heightmaps.
New MERS add more detailed surface roughness. Living Coral Plants now appear noticeably wetter than dead Coral. All Coral variants feature more detailed and consistent materials.

- Particles & Emissives:
Blaze Rods in Brewing Stands now appear more strongly emissive.
Campfire smoke and sulfur cave geyser particle opacities reduced further.

## 1.26.20 [cd:"9999999"] [glyph:"E70F"]
1.26.20 Release Notes:

Full support for Minecraft 1.26.40 and the Chaos Cubed game drop.
BetterRTX 1.5+ is required for Subsurface Scattering and Parallax Occlusion Mapping features.

- Chaos Cubed Game Drop — New Blocks:
Complete PBR support for all new Chaos Cubed blocks: sulfur blocks, potent sulfur, cinnabar block set, and sulfur spikes.
Sulfur Caves biome now features a uniquely sulfuric atmosphere with deep cyan-green water colors matching the vanilla game.

- Sulfur Cube:
Fixed ray tracing rendering issues, including the top texture rendering black and flickering/Z-fighting.
Known issue: interior renders black when the block is submerged but the player camera isn't (or vice versa).
Improved walking animation particles for sulfur cube and slime mobs.

- Cave Biomes — Fog & Atmosphere:
Revamped fog for Deep Dark, Lush Caves, and Dripstone Caves. Water colors now closely match vanilla. Fog heights adjusted to account for surface-exposed generation.
Fixed an issue where the air atmosphere would appear exposed when the camera was inside a small body of water in caves. Note: this is a workaround for a Minecraft bug; it slightly sacrifices vanilla faithfulness in exchange for resolving the issue.

- Subsurface Scattering:
Comprehensive SSS data added to all MER files, which are now migrated to MERS format.
Primarily intended for BetterRTX 1.5+ presets, but can also appear in Vibrant Visuals graphics mode.
All thin surfaces — leaves, foliage, paper parts (e.g. birch trapdoor), even the thin pixels on scaffolding — now properly support light scattering. Every block was individually reviewed.

- Emissive Entities:
Emissive texture data added to all applicable entities. Requires a BetterRTX preset with Emissive Entities enabled.
This is separate from the existing rasterized glowing eyes enhancement and has no impact without BetterRTX installed.
Glow squids, ender chest eyes, ghast mouth and eyes during shooting, drowned, blaze, and many more now feature emissive textures.

- Parallax Occlusion Mapping (Normals & Opus only):
POM data baked into normal maps for use with BetterRTX 1.5+ presets, derived from heightmaps at 1/5th intensity.
Normal maps can be flattened via the Vanilla RTX App; POM data is retained when doing so (a future app update will allow you to reduce POM intensity)
Animated normal map added to the Nether portal texture, creating subtle distortions when viewing anything behind it.

- End Dimension:
Sky overhauled to appear purple instead of black. Fixed lighting issues and addressed unplayability with BetterRTX enabled.
End flash texture made less prominent rather than removed outright, due to it not being properly implemented with ray tracing.

- Particles:
Revamped particle enhancements updated to the latest format version.
Sulfur biome geyser particles tuned for ray tracing. Older particles retuned for more consistent, better-blended opacities throughout.

- Fixes & Minor Enhancements:
Bee nest front: corrected a single misidentified honey pixel, PBR materials adjusted accordingly.
Candle wicks now burn brighter.
Sculk tendril: revised inactive state brightness and fixed heightmap seams in the animation.
XP orb texture bug workaround added (MCPE-183629). Orbs now also glow with an appropriate BetterRTX preset.
Hopper minecart glitchy texture workaround added (MCPE-241124). Model is an approximation until Mojang addresses the issue.
Removed sun and moon enhancements — minimal visual benefit, and they looked off with BetterRTX applied.
Removed unused padding property from terrain_texture.json.
Sulfur cave biome properties updated to match vanilla game parity.
Minimum required Minecraft version raised to 1.26.40, make sure your game is up-to-date.

### Tip [glyph:"E95B"]
Hint: It is always preferred to activate RTX resource packs in your Global Resource Pack settings instead of per-World or Realm.

### Tip [glyph:"E95B"]
Hint: You can come back here to quickly reinstall packs to restore them to their original state in case if you want to revert your tuning attempts. (Reinstalls happen quicker from a cached version, unless a new version happens to be available)

## PSA [cd:"9999999"] [glyph:"ECC5"]
All Vanilla RTX Add-Ons and Extensions have been refreshed for Vanilla RTX 1.26.20 (and higher.)
It is time to update (if you haven't already!) Simply hover their images, and click their names to be taken to their respective CurseForge download pages.

# BetterRTXAnnouncements

## Warning 1 [glyph:"E730"] [cd:"10000"]
Reminder: If your preset list has been auto-reset since your last visit, or this is your first visit:
It is a good idea to wait and check from the BetterRTX Discord whether it has been updated for the latest game version before installing a preset. Installing presets while it serves outdated files could result in crashes and visual glitches. In this scenario, revert to Default RTX, and once BetterRTX is updated, use the refresh button in the top left corner. 
In other words: Minecraft updates can break BetterRTX, it depends on you to update Minecraft, and BetterRTX's maintainer to update it for that game version just in time for everything to continue to work smoothly. If installing BetterRTX causes issues for you, follow these steps:
1. Revert to Default RTX for now
2. Wait until BetterRTX developers confirm they've updated the mod.
3. Use the refresh button in the top left corner to refetch the latest files & continue installing your presets.

## [cd:"120"] [glyph:"F78C"] // check:F78C // warning:E814 // alt text: ATTENTION: DO NOT INSTALL PRESETS FOR NOW. BetterRTX is currently out of date for Minecraft [VERSION]. Once it is updated, the text here will also change. CHECK BACK LATER!
As of MCBE 26.45, it is safe to install BetterRTX presets, the files were tested and the endpoint seems up-to-date for the latest game version, hit the refresh button in the top left corner just to be sure you're not installing old files, and continue to download/import & install presets, also ensure your game is up-to-date.

# LutManagerAnnouncements 
Look up tables provide a simple way to improve or further customize Minecraft RTX, which works across all game versions reliably and without a performance hit as oppposed to heavier modifications such as BetterRTX. Select from the list of available presets and hit install. You can always revert back to defaults by selecting the default preset.

## [glyph:"E7BA"] [cd:"40000"] 
This feature will not work if you're using a BetterRTX Preset. Use Default/Unmodified RTX if you want to use LUT presets.



# DLSSAnnouncements
### A friendly note
Useful fact: the latest DLSS version isn't always the best! Users report 310.5.3.0 is the latest that gives a sharp image. Newer versions and most other versions in-between tend to be a bit blurry!




# ResourcePackSelectionAnnouncements
### Text below is a one time tutorial type of thing! [glyph:"E95B"]
Select from your resource packs from the list below and begin processing them in bulk, tune, delete, or export!
Use the clear selection button in the main window to clear your selections or by hitting confirm without selecting any packs.



# AlchitexDevProgressUpdates [glyph:"EC24"]
The redstone circuits for this feature are still being laid down.
That said, you can come back here anytime to check on the development news.

## [cd:"10000"] [glyph:"E823"]
September News:
Diligently working on it! Expect its initial arrival later next month. I'm trying to make sure the implementation of RTX Reactor into the app is complete as to not require too many updates afterwards. Also as mentioned in the past, this won't be a simple codebase migration, but also a large rewrite, deploying more modern, advanced approaches to per-block procedural PBR texture generation for Minecraft RTX.


# AlchitexAnnouncements [glyph:"F1D6"]
RTX Reactor can add full RTX support to any texture pack. Results may vary and not all texture packs or all textures will be perfect.
Select the packs you want first from the main menu, then come here and press the giant RTX Reactor button.
Packs that are marked as "RTX Reactor Candidate" in the pack selection menu are more likely to be suitable for gaining RTX support through RTX Reactor.
Marketplace resource packs are not supported.

### Info [glyph:"F167"]
Difference of Secondary PBR texture options:
- None: leaves the textures flat. Only roughness, emissive and metalness properties will be added to textures.
- Automatic: automatically picks between Normal Maps, Heightmaps or Both
- Normal Map: Suitable for any resolution, can be selected for any texture pack, defines the direction that light bounces off of each individual pixel, faking curvature and depth on surfaces. Also adds Parallax Occlusion Mapping data (for BetterRTX 1.5+)
- Heightmap: Suitable only for low-resolution texture packs, fakes depth by providing relief around some pixels. Can only be selected for texture packs that are 32x or lower, otherwise it falls back to generating Normal map.

### Info 2 [glyph:"F167"]
Add per-biome RTX atmospheric configs: if toggled on, adds the same per-biome atmospheric variation as Vanilla RTX into the packs.
This is needed for fog, light shafts, and unique per-biome water color and atmospher colors to appear, since most packs don't define these features (especially not for RTX) it is recommended that you leave this on.
If it causes issues for a certain texture pack or takes away from its art direction, turn it off.

You can temporarily dismiss any resource pack from the queue by clicking it.

Uninstall the original pack toggle: If on, the original pack is deleted once and only if the RTX-capable version of the pack is finalized and installed. Convenient to leave on if you repeatedly come back here to re-add RTX support to your favorite texture pack's updates.
